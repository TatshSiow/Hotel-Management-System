This is the page that greeted you after successful login.\
The weather widget is aim to let counters (service center employees) to inform residents whether it is a rainy day or sunny day.
Another thing is, the counter service can tell the residents to prepare an umbrella before going out.
This dashboard also shows the time and date, just in case if the residents asked.
